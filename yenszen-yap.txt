Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
An inline element does not cause a line break and does not take up the full width of the page, but instead only the space bounded by its opening and closing tags. Block elements always starts on a new line as it takes up the full width of the page. It can take up a single or multiple lines and has line breaks before and after the element.
Inline elements can be placed within block elements but not the other way around.

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
It can be positioned anywhere on a page.

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?
